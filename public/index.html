            I wrote and filmed an episode of a show starring Ashton Kutcher, Sam Elliot and Debra Winger, which led to membership in the Writer’s Guild. While working on the series, I pitched story concepts and jokes using Final Draft. Three of the stories were used in the show and over a hundred jokes that I wrote were filmed. Netflix executives asked our writing team to include more political humor in the series and I created examples of how to do so without sacrificing our character’s likability. The New York Times quoted my joke in their review of the show and used it as a reference for how our show handled political humor. After which, this example became a core template for how to write and handle politics within the series.

            I worked as the narrative designer for this school-wide project at USC Games. For the project, I created three enemy characters and two creatures. I used Miro, Notion, Final Draft, Unity, Perforce, and GSuite to collaborate. My work sped up pre-production time by three weeks. I also built a system for creature creation in Google Sheets using game design principles taught at USC that sped up narrative and game design timelines by two weeks. Finally, I collaborated on and presented a narrative deck that detailed the main narrative story, characters, creatures, and world building for the Art and Game Design teams. Currently, I am creating bark sheets and writing character and creature dialogue for the project.

            Solo-developed as a final project at USC Games in 583 Advanced Coding for Designers, Once More Into the Breach is inspired by the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson. Players take on the role of The Champion, an immortal being sent to rid a world of an occupying force of magical cultists. The Champion only has a limited amount of time on the planet before they are banished back to their home world. The game was solo-developed over the course of three weeks and designed in stages to allow for future development.

            Originally solo-developed as a prototype at USC Games in 583 Advanced Coding for Designers, players take on the role of a mother duck who has to protect her ducklings from man-made hazards, like shampoo and soap. Players have to use their wits and their motherly instincts to keep their ducklings safe. The prompt for the project was to create a video game project that uses advanced techiques and has a hidden social message. My intent behind the game was to create a game that was fun and engaging, but also had a message about the difficulties of parenting and keeping children safe in world with an ever-changing environment.

            Developed as a narrative design project at USC Games, BFF is a 2D platformer with ChatGPT Integration in which the main character is training an AI model, while the game player&rsquo;s are also training an AI model in real life. The game was developed in Unity and uses ChatGPT to generate dialogue for the main character. Players walk through a 2D platforming world, collecting items that they can use to train the AI model. In doing so, they uncover the sad movtivations the main character has for training the AI- they lost their friend to a car accident and are trying to recreate them using the AI model. The game was developed in Unity and uses ChatGPT to generate dialogue for NPC&rsquo;s. I served as the lead designer/producer for this project.

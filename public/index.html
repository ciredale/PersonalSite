                <p>- Wrote and filmed an episode of the critically acclaimed Netflix series The Ranch starring Ashton Kutcher, Sam Elliot and Debra Winger, which led to membership in the Writer’s Guild. </p>
              
                <p>- While working on the series, I pitched story concepts and jokes using Final Draft. Three of the stories were used in the show and over a hundred of my jokes were filmed. </p>
              
                <p>- Netflix executives asked our writing team to include more political humor in the series and I created examples of how to do so without sacrificing our character’s likability.</p>
              
                <p>- The New York Times quoted my joke in their review of the show and used it as a reference for how our show handled political humor. After which, this example became a core template for how to write and handle politics within the series.</p>

                <p>- For the project, I created three enemy characters and two creatures. My work sped up pre-production time by three weeks.</p>
              
                <p>- I used Miro, Notion, Final Draft, Unity, Perforce, and GSuite to collaborate with the art, design, UI/UX and production departments.</p>
              
                <p>- I built a system for creature creation in Google Sheets using game design principles taught at USC that sped up narrative and game design timelines by two weeks.</p>
              
                <p>- I collaborated on and presented a narrative deck that detailed the main narrative story, characters, creatures, and world building for the art and game design teams.</p>
              
                <p>- Currently, I am creating bark sheets and writing character and creature dialogue for the project.</p>

                <p>- I created all of the models in Maya, animated them in Maya, and then imported them into Unity. I also used Unity&#39;s AI pathfinding system to create complex AI for the ducklings to follow the Mother Duck.</p>

                <p>- Players traverse across a 2D platforming world, collecting items that they can use to train the AI model. In doing so, they uncover that the main character lost their friend in a car accident and they are recreating them using the AI model.</p>
              
                <p>- The game was developed in Unity using the Corgi Engine and uses ChatGPT API for AI dialogue discussions.</p>
              
                <p>- The AI in the game was trained using a fifteen page script and prompted for each interaction with the players.</p>
              
                <p>- I served as the lead designer/producer for this project.</p>

          <p>Hi! My name is Chris Iredale. I’m a Master’s student in Game Design at the University of Southern California. I’m passionate about storytelling and crafting high-energy, engaging gameplay experiences. My background includes writing for television and film, as well as designing games for both tabletop and digital platforms. I’m actively seeking a position in the game industry where I can leverage my skills to create innovative games that redefine storytelling and gameplay.</p>

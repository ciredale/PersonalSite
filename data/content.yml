    - name: Netflix
      image: 'images/portfolio/Netflix.png'
      description: Wrote and filmed an episode of a show starring Ashton Kutcher, Sam Elliot and Debra Winger, which led to membership in the Writer’s Guild. While working on the series, I pitched story concepts and jokes using Final Draft. Three of the stories were used in the show and over a hundred jokes that I wrote were filmed. Netflix executives asked our writing team to include more political humor in the series and I created examples of how to do so without sacrificing our character’s likability. The New York Times quoted my joke in their review of the show and used it as a reference for how our show handled political humor. After which, this example became a core template for how to write and handle politics within the series.
